phpMyAdmin - Readme
===================

The aim of this repo is to add support for adding a common prefix for column names in "add columns" and table design forms.
This feature request was kinda rejected (see https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/12312).
So I made this fork to use this feature.
All changes are currently on branch "column-name-prefix"
